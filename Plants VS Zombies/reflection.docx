i completed most of the things on my needs to have list and changed the list a bit to realign with my vision for the project.
one of the hardest parts of the project was getting everything to interact with one another such as the zombies eating plants and pea's hitting zombies ect.
I solved all the problems i came across while testing and everything as of when i submitted it works as i intended it to, and hopefully will stay that way.
If i were to restart this project i would try to plan out the things that i need to get done out better and try to have a more concise plan on things that need to be done.
Overall i believe this project went very well and taught me many things aboout problem solving and overall trying to improve my coding skill.
